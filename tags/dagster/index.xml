      <description>Here we will cover our small pipeline written in dagster.
Dagster is a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL
Dagster is a second generation data orchestrator that focues on being data-driven rather than task-driven(like Airflow).
Solids and Pipelines # Dagster&amp;rsquo;s core abstractions are solids and pipelines.
Solids are individual units of computation that we wire together to form pipelines. By default, all solids in a pipeline execute in the same process.</description>

      <description>In this series of posts, we will take a small dataset and go through various steps like building Data pipelines, ML workflow management, API development and Monitoring.
These steps are necessary for operationalization of any machine-learning based model.
These posts are in no way exhaustive in covering the breadth of MLOps.Several key pieces like the CI/CD pipeline, monitoring for drift, etc are missing at the moment, which might get added later.</description>
